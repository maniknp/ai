To install PyTorch, you'll want to follow the steps below. PyTorch is a popular deep learning library that you can install using Python's package manager, `pip`. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Choose Your Installation Method:**
   - **CPU-Only:** For machines without GPUs or if you don't need GPU acceleration.
   - **CUDA (GPU) Version:** For machines with NVIDIA GPUs to take advantage of CUDA for accelerated computations.

2. **Find the Correct Installation Command:**
   Visit the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and use the installation selector to generate the appropriate command for your system.

   For example, if you're using a CPU-only setup with pip, you might use:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```

   For CUDA 11.8, it might look something like:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```

3. **Install PyTorch:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the command generated by the selector. Make sure to use the command appropriate for your system and Python version.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   After installation, you can verify that PyTorch is installed correctly by running a Python script or interactive session and importing PyTorch:

   ```python
   import torch
   print(torch.__version__)
   ```

```python
# Make sure your system has an NVIDIA GPU. You can check this by running:
lspci | grep -i nvidia
```

```python 
import torch

# Check if CUDA is available and set device accordingly
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Your code logic here
if torch.cuda.is_available() and torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).major >= 8:
    # Your GPU code
    pass
else:
    # Fallback to CPU
    print("CUDA not available, running on CPU.")


```
